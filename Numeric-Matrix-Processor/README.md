### About this project
Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.7
- To run the tests: https://github.com/hyperskill/hs-test-python

`python processor.py`


# Code it yourself: 
## 1. Addition
<p>Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.</p>

<p>Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-arrays. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix. At first, you will work with matrices with integer elements, and later the elements will be floating-point numbers.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let’s start with matrix addition.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Reads matrix ( A ) from the input.</li>
	<li>Reads matrix ( B ) from the input.</li>
	<li>Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, it should output the <code class="java">ERROR</code> message.</li>
</ol>

<p>Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the matrix.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4 5
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 3 2 1
8 0 9 9 1
1 3 4 5 6
4 5
1 1 4 4 5
4 4 5 7 8
1 2 3 9 8
1 0 0 0 1</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2 3 7 8 10
7 6 8 9 9
9 2 12 18 9
2 3 4 5 7</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2 3
1 4 5
4 5 5
4 5
0 1 0 4 5
1 7 8 9 4
1 2 3 5 6
1 3 4 3 8</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">ERROR</code></pre>
