<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>We are at the finish line! But playing alone is not so interesting, is it? Let's combine our successes in past stages and get Tic-Tac-Toe with the ability to play from the beginning (empty field) to the result (win or draw).</p>

<p>Now it is time to make a working game!</p>

<p>In the last stage, make it so you can play a full game with a friend. First one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Prints an empty field at the beginning of the game.</li>
	<li>Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a field with the changes if everything is ok.</li>
	<li>Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to output the final result after the end of the game.</p>

<p>Good luck gaming!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.<br>
The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
