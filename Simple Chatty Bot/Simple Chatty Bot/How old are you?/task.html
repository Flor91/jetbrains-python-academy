<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Keep improving your bot by developing new skills for it. We suggest a simple guessing game that will predict the age of a user.</p>

<p>It's based on a simple math trick. First, take a look at this formula:</p>

<pre><code class="java">age = (remainder3 * 70 + remainder5 * 21 + remainder7 * 15) % 105</code></pre>

<p>The numbers<code class="java">remainder3</code>, <code class="java">remainder5</code> and <code class="java">remainder7</code> are the remainders of division by 3, 5 and 7 respectively.</p>

<p>It turns out that for each number ranging from <em>0</em> to <em>104</em> the calculation will result in the number itself. This perfectly fits the ordinary age range, doesn't it? Ask a user for the remainders and use them to guess the age!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objective</h2>

<p>At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. It will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.</p>

<p>Your program should print the following lines:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {your_age}; that's a good time to start programming!</code></pre>

<p>Read three numbers from the standard input. Assume that all the numbers will be given on separate lines.</p>

<p>Instead of <code class="java">{your_age}</code>, the bot will print the age determined according to the special formula discussed above.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>a dialogue with the bot</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
&gt; Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!</code></pre>
